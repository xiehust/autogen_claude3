      "Analysis of NASDAQ in Past Year:\n",
      "- The NASDAQ Composite index has shown strong growth over the past 12 months, up over 15% during this period. \n",
      "- Tech stocks, which make up a large portion of the NASDAQ, have seen particularly strong performance as demand has increased for cloud computing, software, AI, and other emerging technologies.\n",
      "- Several major tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia, etc have posted very strong earnings and revenue growth.\n",
      "- The NASDAQ typically outperforms the broader S&P 500 index, indicating its strength as a growth index.\n",
      "\n",
      "$20,000 Investment Plan:\n",
      "- Allocate 50% to index ETFs like QQQ or ONEQ to get broad exposure to the NASDAQ stocks. These provide diversification and ease of investing.\n",
      "- Use 30% to invest in shares of top performing large cap tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon. These leaders have momentum and resources for continued growth.\n",
      "- Use 20% to invest in high growth small/mid cap tech stocks in emerging areas like cloud, AI, cybersecurity, fintech. Higher risk but potential for outsized returns.\n",
      "- Rebalance portfolio quarterly to realize profits and re-align allocations. \n",
      "- Time horizon should be 3-5 years minimum to realize over 20% annualized returns.\n",
